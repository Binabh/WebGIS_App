                                    Kathmandu University is an autonomous, not-for-profit, non - government institution
                                    dedicated to maintain high standards of academic excellence. It is committed to
                                    develop leaders in professional areas through quality education.</p>
                                <p>

                                    It is located in a mountainous landscape in Dhulikhel Municipality about 30
                                    kilometers east of Kathmandu (KTM) having round-the-year pleasant climate and
                                    panoramic Himalayan Views.</p>
                                <p>
                                    KU had a very modest start from a rented building at Tangal, Kathmandu. Now, it has
                                    been able to create a built up space of 46,846 square meters.</p>
                                <p>

                                    Within a period of 21 years, KU has built not only reasonable infrastructure, but
                                    also established a track record of academic excellence. At present, the University
                                    offers various undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate programs in science,
                                    engineering, medicine, management, education, arts, pharmacy, environment, music,
                                    human & natural resources, information technology and biotechnology, through School
                                    of Science, School of Management, School of Engineering, School of Medical
                                    Sciences, School of Education and School of Arts. In addition to 3695 students
                                    studying in its constituent campuses 7500 students are in its affiliated colleges.</p>
                                <p>

                                    The academic programs of the University are based on credit-semester system with
                                    continuous internal evaluations. The University has adopted 1 to 10 teacherâ€“student
                                    ratio. However, KU is very cautious in recruitment of every single faculty or
                                    non-teaching staff. The staff strength at KU is 458 for teaching and 725 for
                                    nonteaching (Including Paramedical staff). The academic calendar of minimum 230
                                    days is strictly adhered to; admission of students is based on merit, based on
                                    their score in the previous examination and written and oral entrance tests.</p>
                                <p>

                                    Every School has its own Teacher Welfare Society, Student Welfare Council and Staff
                                    Welfare Society. The Executive Board is composed of members elected by teachers and
                                    students for the welfare of their community. Quality control is strictly followed
                                    in all programs of the university. In addition, to continually enhance the
                                    educational standard, KU has been successfully collaborating with more than fifty
                                    universities and institutions of international repute for faculty and students
                                    exchange programs, credit transfer and joint research work and exchange
                                    information. This has helped KU to establish itself well in the world community.</p>

                                    course which is divided into 8 semesters. This project is done as the project for
                                    one of our courses in 4th year, 1st semester of our study which is Wed GIS. The
                                    works done in this course are discussed below.
